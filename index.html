        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Canada (Regina, Saskatchewan) and moved to the United States when I was 8 years old. I grew up with my 2 sisters and parents in Kokomo, Indiana (about 40 miles north of Indianapolis, IN). I studied Communication and Culture at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana (Go Hoosiers!) After graduating from Indiana University in 2010, I moved to Chicago, Illinois. In Chicago I held a few sales jobs, and eventually found my way into Logistics. I worked my way up and around from brokerage operations into project management, and eventually found myself in a Technical Program Management (TPM) role. Most recently I was tasked with taking on the TPM role for the first phase of the mission to unify the Shopify Fulfillment Network and the Deliverr products. The goal was to successfully onboard 1 new merchant onto a unified Shopify/Deliverr experience. This project required coordinating teams across disciplines between product, engineering, operations, sales, onboarding, and support. The pilot client was onboarded mid-October and has been successfully fulfilling orders on the unified experience ever since.</p>
